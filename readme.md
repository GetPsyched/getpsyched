Hello. I am a software developer. I build things that excite me, usually having little visible similarities.

I love to code random but useful ideas that pop in my head from time to time. I don't have a fixed stack that I like working on yet; albeit I've explored a lot of languages and technologies through various side projects. Even so, I can safely say that my most used languages are TypeScript, Python, and Go.

Although I enjoy cycling alone, most of my day is spent indoors either doing random things on my laptop, chatting, coding, playing video games, or decorating my room; all while jamming to music.
